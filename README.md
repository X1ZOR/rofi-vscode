## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/blob/next/INSTALL.md#install-distribution).

To install the script you can easily move it a binary dictionary on your system, e.g. ``/usr/bin/``. Or you can just leave it anywhere else and run the script in this folder.

## Usage

##### Example

If the script is in a binary directory:
``rofi-vscode "/path/to/your/workspaces"``

Without: 
``/path/to/the/script/rofi-vscode "/path/to/your/workspaces"``

Replace ``/path/to/your/workspaces`` with the directory of your vscode workspaces.

The script will open a rofi dmnenu where it will list all the directories in the given workspaces directory. If you select a directory (or project) it will open it in vscode.

The ``Add new workspace`` functionality asks your for new directory name and creates a new directory in the workspaces folder.
